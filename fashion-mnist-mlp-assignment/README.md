# Fashion Mnist Keras MLP Assignment

This repository contains python code solving the problem of classifying
instances from the famous _fashion MNIST_ dataset. It does so using
the _sequential_ model from the [Keras](https://keras.io/) library in a
clean and modular approach.

## Running and configuring the code

To run the code, simply run `main.py`. Doing so will start a hyperparameter
search for various hyperparameters. The most essential variables are
found in the `config.py` file, providing an easier time reading and 
configuring the code.
